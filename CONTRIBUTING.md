# Contributing Guidelines (for myself)

## Naming rules
- Use numbered folders: `01-...`, `02-...`
- Lab folders: `01-title-with-dashes`

## Each lab must include
- Goal
- Scenario
- Steps
- Root cause
- Fix
- Verification
- Ticket notes

## Evidence rules
- Put screenshots/logs inside `evidence/` in the lab folder
- No personal info in screenshots
