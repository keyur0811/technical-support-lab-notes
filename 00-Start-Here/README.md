## How this repo is organized
Each folder represents a support domain (AD, Networking, OS, etc.).  
Each lab follows the same structure so it’s easy to review and expand.

## How to add a new lab (fast)
1. Create a new folder in the correct category, using the next number:
   - Example: `03-Active-Directory-User-Management/05-disable-enable-account/`
2. Copy the template from: `90-Templates/lab-template.md`
3. Add screenshots/logs into an `evidence/` folder (optional)
4. Commit and push
